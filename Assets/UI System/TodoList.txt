 
//Branch Fixes

- add Disable Branch functionality (disables all). It just disables all Nodes. Link to switcher (move or not option and check when switching)
    Check when all nodes are disabled in branch that it will switch to next branch and / or pass over it when switching when set to
- Make MoveToBranch Call OnEnable, StartBranchExit to call OnDisable.
   Only active branches and nodes are assigned to Events etc (Potentially quick big!!)
- Disable /  enable Branches working still (removes from groups and can a add to group). Need to fix Dynamic Branches so functionality works
- Turn off Canvas then disable for Dynamic branches / Nodes. Needed for pooling
- Stop Parent Branch re-opening child when it is already open/tweening from a different parent.
- Runtime Pool setting which disables everything i.e RestoreBranch and also check that it can be activated as it's pooled

//Control Bar
- Doesn't work properly, sometimes disappears on going to full screen (to with Trunk). Need to add itself to each trunks switcher and be independant

//Trunk
- Add option to not tween branches when opening or closing a trunk
- Trunk needs to have Immediate or AfterExit option to tween
- Update Make New tree Button

//Runtime Setter
- Rework to have all functionality needed
   
//Switcher
- Checks for disables branch and skip
- Add loop around or not option

// Auto Open Close
- Doesn't work properly with Multi- Select
- Doesn't Stay closed when escape pressed from child

//Multi Select
- Make work with any node. Will need option to be set or not depending on node type
- Turn into a Scriptable object like with toggle group.
 
//HistoryManagement
- Cancel has no sound
- When Escape pressed doesn't go back to parent node in branch but last highlighted. Must be parent node
- Have clear current Trunk cancel option (maybe on the back of currentSwitcher list)


//Hub
- New Button in Hub to create project properly (canvas and scaler set-up correctly). 
    Or have a scriptable project settings file that can be dragged in
- Remove Load next scene, add to seperate script
- Hard coded in delay in Hub to stop race conditions. Remove this by calling OnEnable in MoveToBranch (see Branch todo list)
- Check constructor buttons all work properly
- Move Where to start into approaprite class. At the moment it is in various places. Moving Input may help this as settings move to Hub

//UiInput
- Start with Keys doesn't work
- Make UI Input a normal c# class and have settings in Hub
- Make Hotspot class for VC
- Make sure mouse hiding is working properly
- Make sure mouse doesn't work when Controller is active
- Implement new input system
- Add timer to VC raycast so does it every other frame (for example) to improve performace)
- Add check that goes through HotKeys and checks for duplicate hotkey assignments

//Nodes
- Add Checks for empty schemes on all Nodes (warning or exception??)
- Make a linked / Shadow / Mimic / bypass system that passes on controls to / copies the state of the linked branch / node
    What happens to me isn't tracked but happens to you. That way it doesn't matter what the node is doing.
 - Sliders, do they work
 - Check functionality with other UI types (scroll bars etc etc). Maybe need tween for scroll bar value?
 - Add loop around or not to auto navigation
 
 //Drag Bar
 - Add drag bar functionality. Will work on Branch or node. Seperate Class. Have save new setting or reset position on close (See Tweener for other settings needed)
 - Make a reordrable list as a seperate class that can be added to branch with allows adding, removing, or repostion nodes in branch. See below:
        - When released ontop or over (as option) of other node in same branch swap positions & reorder in autonav. Or dragged in add to
        - Allow removal from Branch when dragged off - All Linked to Dynamic Nodes
 
 //Dynamic Nodes - see above
 - Make sure this works. Linked to Drag bar functionality
 - Have option to replace with another object (i.e a place holder to not break layout group)

//Tweeners
- Replace all node tweening to be done via UITween instead. Means making it a class, node functions inherit it and have a Mono that serialises it. 
    Also need to restrict usage in node functions so colour can't move too. 
    - Need to look at redesign and fesablility first. Redsign could incluse:
            - Seperate class for Start, Middle Ends
            - Set either by Rect Settings (as is now), relative, fed from external script or target object
            - Have a grab current position option too
 - Add Target Object to Position tween
 - Add Time Percentage to other tweens
 - Add Looping to tweener
 - Make sure tweens sequence without timer (may need to add this option
 - Update all Tweens so they only set to start settings when used
 - Need to implement isRelative to Position to make it easier to move Branches with screen size and dragBar
 - Have a runtime setter function so can set values on the fly (search list by using recttransform). 
    This also good for making scrollbar selection menus etc
 - Add a Horizontial and Vertical lock option to stop dragging breaking tweening off screen
 - Add colour & Event call(so can caal custom script instead of Tween) option to tweener like from Node (cut and paste)
 
//GOUI
- Make GOUI switcher work like other ones i.e replaces currentSwitcher
- When selecting an already selected GOUI there is no sound
- Offscreen marker needs a max distance from camera cull setting so doesn't mark forever
- Rework InGameObject reporting to DataHub

//MyDataHub
- InGame / InMenu needs checking and rework

//EZEvent, EzService, Eject
- look at moving EZvents to spereate Mono's so can activae in scene by adding to Gameobject
- look into using same buffering system in Events as in Services
- EJect need no params and params??
- Fetch<> have interface check like EZvent (not sure what this is??)

//Audio
- Needs master audio Access point that applies to all schemes

//Tooltips
- Grab current canvas sorting order and add 1 rather than use Preset from Hub
- Changing screen resolution doesn't break functionality, especially tooltips (may need to grab data when active not at start)
- May need to change how I check screen size
- Review GetTooltipFolder  in SetUpTooltipClass

//General Test
- Check switching between scenes doesn't break system
